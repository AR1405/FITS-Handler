# FITS Handler Project

The FITS Handler project provides a comprehensive solution for handling FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files commonly used in astronomy for storing and transmitting data. This project aims to extract useful information from FITS files, such as header information, and provides functionality to display images based on brightness values stored in the file. Additionally, it offers tools for data analysis on the extracted data.

## Features

- **FITS File Info Extraction**: Extract header information from FITS files.
- **Image Display**: Display the image stored in FITS files based on brightness values.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform various data analysis tasks on the extracted data, such as histogram plotting, statistical analysis, etc.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily integrate the FITS handler into existing Python projects for astronomy data processing and analysis.
